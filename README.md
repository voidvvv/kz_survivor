### Why is Java?
Maybe you have the question: why do you make a game in Java? there are lots of other Game Dev Engine and languages, such as Unity, Unreal Engine, C++, C#, Python, etc. Why do you choose Java?
I choose Java because I am familiar with it, and I think it is a good language for game development.
And thanks for LIBGDX, it is a great game development framework for Java. It provides a lot of features and tools to make game development easier and more efficient.
In my own opinion, Java could be a good programming language for game development, especially for 2D games. With the help of libraries like LibGDX, developers can create games that are not only functional but also visually appealing and engaging.
